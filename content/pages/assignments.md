Assignments consist of presentations on assigned papers, daily synopses of these presented papers, and a 10-15 page research paper (optional for undergraduates, required for graduates).

Before class each student is to prepare a synopsis of the two articles that will be presented that day. Each synopsis should be a paragraph summarizing the article followed by two substantive questions for discussion. Please hand your synopses to the TA at the end of each class. This exercise is intended to make you sufficiently familiar with the articles to permit an intelligent discussion after each presentation.
